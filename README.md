# [GitHub business card generator](https://github-business-card.vercel.app)

This is an app I built to play with [Vercel’s image generation library](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation).

Have a look at the serverless function in [pages/api/github.tsx](https://github.com/scastiel/github-business-card/blob/main/pages/api/github.tsx). It’s where the image is generated.

If you’re curious how image generation works, check out this [tutorial I wrote on my blog](https://scastiel.dev/create-og-images-for-your-blog-with-nextjs).

And if you’re interested in Next.js, also [check out the book I wrote about it](https://amzn.to/3EtlfVB).
